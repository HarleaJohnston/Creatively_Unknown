        <p>
            Hello My Name is Quill, I am a ecletic artist jumping from media to media. Doing whatever feels right in the month. As I mentioned before I am a web dev turned artist.
            Really put myself in debt to not use it huh? Oh, well I love what I am doing currently even though the debt is crippling. I have fun working my own hours and thats all that really matters at the end of the day right?
            Thats what I'm going to keep telling myself.
        </p>
