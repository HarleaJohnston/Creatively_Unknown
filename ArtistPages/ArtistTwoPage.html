        <p>
            Hello My Name is Quill, I am a ecletic artist jumping from media to media. Doing whatever feels right in the month. As I mentioned before I am a web dev turned artist.
            Really put myself in debt to not use it huh? Oh, well I love what I am doing currently even though the debt is crippling. I have fun working my own hours and thats all that really matters at the end of the day right?
            Thats what I'm going to keep telling myself. I am 25 years old, I spend most of my days with my dog and cats in the great indoors. Air conditioning beats nature every day. When I am not doing art I am playing games online with friends,
            annoying my sister with out of the blue calls and loungeing on my deck when the moon begins to rise.
        </p>
